This was the Bachelor Thesis test project. 


The idea was simple; Machine Learns the article for demanding Questions. Then, the NLP model learns the article with trained model.
Finally, machine creates Answers to user without any changes. I used AllenNLP library and Google Colab with python3. It works in Turkish and English. You Can also try with your articles and make sure to tell the results :)
